# Coding_Active
# The Polyglot Programmer Project

An experiment in comparative analysis to build programming maturity. This repo documents a journey to solve the same problems in C, C++, Python, C#, and Rust.

## The Core Philosophy

We are often told to "master one language." But what if we mastered the logic behind them all?

The goal of this project is not to learn five syntaxes, but to develop unconventional, out-of-the-box problem-solving. We get stuck in paradigms—the "Python way" or the "C# way." This project is a deliberate effort to break those mental boxes.

By building projects side by side, this repository will serve as a living document, comparing how different programming languages tackle identical challenges. We will explore:

How C still powers the world with manual, low-level control.

Why Python's speed of development is a superpower.

How C++ balances high-level abstraction with "zero-cost" performance.

Why C#'s managed runtime and rich frameworks dominate the enterprise.

Why Rust's "fearless concurrency" and safety model are revolutionary.

This is a project-based learning experience, conducted in public, with a focus on comparative analysis.

## The Languages

C: The Foundation (Manual Memory, Pointers, Procedural)

C++: The High-Performance Hybrid (OOP, RAII, Templates)

Python: The High-Level Powerhouse (Dynamic Typing, Rapid Dev)

C#: The Enterprise Standard (Modern OOP, Garbage Collection, . .NET)

Rust: The Modern Systems Challenger (Memory Safety, Ownership, Concurrency)

## Repository Structure

Each project has a top-level directory. Inside, each language implementation gets its own sub-directory.

01-CLI-Calculator:
*  c
*  cpp
*  python
*  csharp
*  rust

02-Word-Count-Tool:
*  c
* ...

* README.md


## The Curriculum

###Level 1: The "Rosetta Stone"

Implement all projects in all five languages to build a foundation.

[ ] Project 1.1: CLI Calculator

[ ] Project 1.2: Word Count Tool (wc clone)

[ ] Project 1.3: CLI To-Do List (with JSON persistence)

### Level 2: Idiomatic Deep Dive

Pick the 2-3 best languages for the job and compare their idiomatic strengths.

[ ] Project 2.1: Simple Web Scraper

[ ] Project 2.2: Simple REST API Backend

[ ] Project 2.3: Simple GUI Application

[ ] Project 2.4: Multi-threaded Search Tool (grep clone)

### Level 3: The Capstone

Build one large, complex system in the single most appropriate language.

[ ] (TBD) Key-Value Store (Redis Clone)

[ ] (TBD) LISP Interpreter

[ ] (TDB) 2D Game Engine (from scratch)

## Follow The Journey

This repository serves as the "proof of work." The "story" — my "a-ha!" moments, detailed comparisons, and weekly learnings — is documented on LinkedIn.
